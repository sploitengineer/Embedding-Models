Solution Brief:
Using our Architecture and System Design Libraries Recommendation System in Pfizer’s development workflow helps new joiners quickly select the right tools and libraries. The system leverages advanced text-retrieval techniques—combining BM25 ranking with real-time user feedback—to match project queries with a curated database. This approach automates library selection, ensures consistent tech stack usage, and significantly reduces manual research time, thereby accelerating onboarding and improving collaboration among teams.

Business Benefits:
Implementing this recommendation system boosts productivity and efficiency by up to 80%, reducing the effort required for library research and integration. It standardizes technology selection across projects, shortens onboarding cycles, and enhances code quality by promoting best-practice libraries. By integrating secure, locally hosted ranking algorithms and continuous feedback loops, the platform empowers both new and experienced developers at Pfizer to align quickly with the company’s technical standards, ultimately supporting faster project delivery and better client outcomes.
